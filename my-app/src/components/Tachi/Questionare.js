      " AVNRT denotes re-entry in the area of the AVN, but the exact circuit remains elusive. The AVN is a three-dimensional structure with greater variability in the space constant of tissue, and poor gap junction connectivity due to differential expression of connexin isoforms, conditions that provide an explanation for dual conduction and nodal re-entrant arrhythmogenesis.",
      "Accessory pathways are single or multiple strands of myocardial cells that bypass the physiological conduction system, and directly connect atrial and ventricular myocardium. APs are crucial in pathogenesis of AVRT. ",
      "AVNRT stands for  atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia which ir the most common atrioventricular junctional arrhythmia ",
      " Orthodromic AVRT accounts for >90% of AVRTs and for 20 - 30% of all sustained SVTs. Antidromic AVRT occurs in 3 - 8% of patients with WPW syndrome. The re-entrant impulse travels from the atrium to the ventricle through the AP with anterograde conduction; meanwhile, retrograde conduction occurs over the AVN or another AP, usually located in a contralateral position to ensure longer travel distances, thus allowing for sufficient recovery of refractoriness of the respective elements of the re-entrant circuit.",
